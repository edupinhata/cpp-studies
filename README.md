# Stroustrup Studies

### Motivation

After I entered in Thales Group company, I started to need C++. 
As the colege programming level required is not high, I never needed to go deep in a language as now. So I got the Stroustrup book "The C++ Programming Language" and will start a project to read at least a chapter per week.

The book has 44 chapters with 1267 pages, which gives an average of 29 pages per week. Hopefully I'll complete the read in the first trimester of 2019. This repository was made to follow my steps in this jorney. A lot of code will be made to better understand the concepts in this language.
